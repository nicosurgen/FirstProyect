# Description of the project
In this first project, what I am going to do is an analysis and cleaning of the data from a dataset about smartphones. The dataset was obtained through web scraping. My objectives for this project are:

- To perform a proper Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset.
- To carry out the cleaning of the dataset.
- To prepare the dataset to be used in a machine learning project, such as a price regression or average rating prediction.
- Use the dataset to perform certain machine learning tasks.
- Give a conclusion on the most important characteristics of the models to obtain the value of the target variables.

## EDA and Data Cleaning
**The steps I'm going to follow are as follows:**

- Perform an exploration of the variables and the data each one provides.
- Data conversion for better understanding.
- EDA analysis of numeric variables.
- EDA analysis of categorical variables.
- Analysis of NaN values and their resolution.
- Cleaning of the format of categorical variables using regular expressions.
- Duplicate analysis.
- Saving of the new clean dataset.
